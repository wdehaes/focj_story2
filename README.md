## What’s the headline of this story?

The RealReal, authenticity at scale?

## What’s the story about?

While The RealReal positions itself as a fast-growing online marketplace for second-hand designer goods with a focus on technology and expert authentication. However,
if you compare The RealReal’s revenue and the inventory on their website, it seems impossible for the X experts to authenticate all of these items.

Based on online employee reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Indeed, as well as existing news coverage, it seems most of the authentication is done by copywriters who work for low wages and who claim to have high daily quotas of over 120 pieces/day (or 4 minutes per piece for authentication and paperwork).

There are several groups of people for whom this way of working is problematic:
- customers who, based on The RealReal’s advertisements, might expect a piece authenticated by an expert. There are many posts on fashion fora of disgruntled consumers who bought fakes on The RealReal. And there is an ongoing lawsuit by Chanel claiming employees at The RealReal are not equipped to authenticate Chanel products, and hence the company is selling fakes on their website.
- employees, who, if the claims are verified, are working in a very taxing, high pressure work environment
- investors, insofar that they are not aware what is going on behind the scenes at The RealReal

## Computational story potential:

I set out to do an analysis of the online resale market, but based on the publicly available (i.e. scrapeable without violating terms of service) data, I did not find a newsworthy story.

While the above findings at The RealReal are story-worthy and seemingly under-reported, I am not sure how much value computation would add to this story or where it would be applied.

There are about 400 online employee reviews, which can be analysed manually. It is also not clear to me what additional insight computational analysis would bring.

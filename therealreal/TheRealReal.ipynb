       "'The hierarchy is sometimes hard to follow, there are a lot of managers/directors and it\\'s not always easy to understand who you should go to for what. There is also a lot of job movement so the person you talked to last week about something maybe in a new role this week and you had no idea that changed happened. still very much a start-up It’s not an easy job. The quotas can be difficult to make depending on how you feel that day, what items you’re working on and whether or not you took too much time at lunch. Individual copywriters are also held responsible if a fake item gets through, so it can be stressful. However, you can tell the company recognizes this and tries to make up for it with flexible scheduling and lunches. The job also feels a lot... Unrealistic goals and treatmen tof empolyees 16 bucks an hour is not a living wage in the Bay Area. Get real. Minimum wage for hard work, on your feet all day, keeps the turn over rate high. Must be at current position for a whole year before applying for other positions, that don\\'t seem to pay much more. Where should I even start? Should we talk about how employees no longer get any Holidays off? What about the part where employees are paid below a livable wage for the Bay Area while management continue to raise quotas and expectations with NO pay raise. How about the part where people were once forced to work in the warehouse (that had literal SMOKE and hazardous air quality) during the massive paradise fires? Talk... The managers are petty, HR is terrible, our working conditions are even worse. the list goes on.... Please dont waste your time working for this company. Theres been multiple occasions where my paychecks were shorted money, I still dont know if I\\'m being paid correctly. I thought it\\'d be worth it to work at TRR but I wake up everyday wishing I didnt have to go to work but unfortunately I need the money. \\n\\nI\\'ll say... PAY!!! No employee perks or discounts, Work life balance is terrible , communication between recruitment and actually in store leadership are not consistent. So many things you are told/ offered changes when you actually start working. This position does most of the work in the store and the least paid helping every single department with sales, scheduling appointments, even the cafe sometimes, handling returns,... Low Pay, Repetitive, Dealing with Angry Customers/Consignors I don\\'t have nothing negative to say about the company Lots of turnover with operations. Leadership is rarely even at the warehouse. Meanwhile we are trying to cobble together various inventory and warehouse systems to help \"automate\" a supply chain that is massively human capital intensive and cannot be handled by machines. Upper management has no grasp of this reality and blames the constant service shortfalls on ops when in fact they\\'ve set totally unattainable... Once I left I realized how terrible it was and needed time for both emotional and psychical recovery. This job violates so many labor laws. This job has mandatory overtime ( 9 hours a day every at the last week of the month), working 6 consecutive days at the end of the month, no holidays off, quotas changing without pay compensation, exploitation of workers without college degrees, wage slavery, manipulation of... Where to even begin? First of all, the business model of TRR is impossible to scale. The fact that they were able to swindle anyone into investing into this horrible idea is mindblowing. The lack of scalability, coupled with a completely baffled and lost management team, is the sole reason this place is a hell hole.\\n\\nAllow me to explain.\\n\\nEvery single item that is for sale on the TRR website must be INDIVIDUALLY... At first it seems like a pretty good job that can potentially become a career. After a few weeks you are expected to hit a ridiculous goal. I promise your eyes, back, and shoulders will be killing you after 6 months. Everyday for 8+ or 10+ hours you sit at your tight desk with terrible lighting and process items all day long. The goal is constantly being raised for no reason. Because of this, it forces copywriters... Awful atmosphere, petty management, it was overall a sad a demoralizing place. - Work conditions are horrendous\\n- Management are the biggest flaw of the entire operation\\n- No communication \\n-Write ups for pretty much any reason they desire (if you aren’t kissing butt) \\n-NO PROMOTIONS FROM WITHIN(unless you’re friends with a manager already) \\n-The More work you’re expected to do the less you get paid. \\nAny so many more cons The company is a con, understaffed, low pay and underqualified employees Quota based work that is not transparent when you first start. Lifting mannequins over and over again is very taxing on the back and I\\'m a young able bodied person. They treat the photographers like lower class citizens because we\\'re really just disposable and it\\'s about shoving as much product through the pipeline as possible. managers are terrible; there are cliques and gossip and unprofessional people who pretend to work in fashion; all around bad experience. HR, Upper management is not knowledgeable, unorganized, and the pay is not competitive, no room for growth. No windows as its kind of Lab atmosphere. Gem identification lab is common. You gets loop and other small equipments though. Have to make goals. None really, being a baby but fast growing company! Severely mismanaged. Claims to be green but waists more paper than any company I know of. Lack of systems requires excessive use of paper that just gets tossed. No operational sense and the owner is all about appearances and not about infrastructure. Still working as if they are in the early 90’s but expect miracles and efficiency. There’s a reason why there are so many horrible reviews and so many people leave They deducted more than US$500 worth of taxes from my paychecks that they weren\\'t supposed to, and when I reached out to payroll about it, they said they couldn\\'t refund me, that I\\'d have to do that through IRS and apply to get the taxes back. Turns out I can\\'t do that because they misspelled my name on my W2 form and they have been ignoring my emails about correcting it. Huge disappointment! \\nAlso, they say they... Stylist need to be more strict on what that pick to be evaluated. Benefits could be better, but unlimited time off policy is great Dealing with the mannequin. the management is very unprofessional, they are still going through growing pains as if they are a brand new company, terrible training , no growth or promotions Goals, expectations, long hours, treatment of employees. Across the board, most employees are unhappy working for this company, including management. Not really a place to grow a career. The strict time constraints for goals Lowest pay I’ve ever seen. Let’s hire for a professional retoucher with years of experience who went through schooling and training and pay him a few bucks more than In n Out while the ceo keeps all the big money. because of constant growth, there is so much change Horrible management \\nNo structure \\nNo one seems to know what they’re doing \\nTurnover is incredibly high Need to get rid of the weaker links. It’s been a great experience and there is nothing I can think of to improve. No room for growth, rampant nepotism Everybody is overworked and underpaid. Long hours, no holidays. Focus is on quantity over quality. Lunches often no provided, rude upper management, take advantage of employees times. Get the offer the verbal tell you in writing before signing on. Leadership gets defensive when asked questions.\\n\\nConsignments are labeled with a post it and then shoved into a room with zero care. They are then shoved into a non a/c controlled van. There is zero care taken with your items. I have seen Hermes and Chanel bags under... Most disorganized place I have ever worked. Management doesn\\'t know what they want, business side is completely out to lunch. Stay far away There are holes in the ceiling of the women\\'s bathroom. There is little to no opportunity for growth. Your responsibilities will increase ten fold, but you will receive the minimum raise every review. PTO system, Poor office culture and environment Customers are horrible & make the job difficult Company is a revolving door. Class action suit waiting to happen if they don\\'t listen to the needs of their employees. Paying NJ state taxes if you commute from neighboring states. Too many changes in upper level management. Management can play favorites/politics sometimes. Hiring managers did a horrible job explaining the details of the actual job I would be doing - lots of smoke and mirrors.\\n\\nLots of promises made that were not backed up.\\n\\nSenior leadership is extremely unprofessional with no compassion for those on the front line, poor communication. Most managers are good with an exception of a few. In fact, there\\'s specifically ONE manager that seems kind of racist. It\\'s so obvious that managers don\\'t communicate with each other since their guidelines always contradict with one another. In other words, among the managers favoritism is so obvious. Absolutely the worst job position I ever had. Abusive rude managers who were unrealistic and caddy. The job itself is obscene where you are literally schelping designer crap to and from peoples homes like a messenger.... however that is just one facet to this never ending sad job. Unrealistic quotas, petty criticism instead of praise.... and then there is the core group of employees that have been there since the... Terribly managed, everyone is overworked and underpaid, no holidays, awful and unsafe working conditions for the home and art team. Management was consistently condescending and only cared about themselves- one manager in particular loved to power trip and along with being gloriously incompetent, was pretty sexist. He once outed a girl for being on her period in the MIDDLE OF A MEETING. He also once told a... Despite making less mistakes and producing more, being paid less and not considered to have \\'leadership\\' skills for a more senior position. Growing so quick there is a lot changes and moving around Poor communication between management and employees.\\nUnexpected additional workloads.\\nChanges every few weeks disrupting the flow of the office. I can\\'t think of anything, I love working at TRR The downsides to working here, I’ll just list them below; \\n• underpaid\\n• copywriters are not valued( so if you do get job here just make sure it’s in management) that is the only way the company will respect you and care about what you have to say. \\n• there is constant change every week. \\n• promoting people who are not qualified\\n• lack of communication from upper management \\n• the company does not set you up... whole bunch of high school graduates work here to create a hostile work environment. Worst HR department. Although we are more mature than a startup, it is still very much \"startup mentality\" here. Being able to quickly adapt to change is important. Internal systems are still being built out, and are not always working as well as expected. You will wear several hats in whatever role you are in. \\n\\nPromotions/advancements are not handed out automatically. I\\'ve had to apply for and interview for each of the internal... Long hours with a lot of work. No Cons in my experience. The business changes courses quickly and to be successful you must be nimble. *Constant* changes to the compensation structure was questionable. Continuing to increase quotas seemed more like they were trying to save money for the company and not payout \"upsell.\" The turnover on the overall sales team was also concerning. This role should have better benefits and compensation. \\n\\nThe HR team is a disaster: unreliable and unprofessional. Lack of accountability/problem solving in customer relations which leads to apologizing/losing clients when it’s out of your control Nowhere to move up, Uninteresting projects, Cheap, lowballing everyone\\nCulture is like high school, some people are rude and downright mean, Lot of deadweight that drags everyone else down, No one can make up their mind\\nHealthcare is a joke quota oriented position, warehouse is dusty Incredibly low pay. Clueless, inexperienced management that think they are totally clued in and experienced. They are not. It\\'s hard to meet all of the high-level directors or executives of each department because their plates are so full, but they are always open and friendly via email. Uneducated, tactless, second chance employees that take all the food from the cafeteria, scream across the halls, walk really slow in front of you like they have no place to be. lots of change to adapt to Training, work life balance, cliques, end of month goals leave less work to life balance Oh where to begin...\\n-Policies and SOPs are changing frequently, often attributed to “still being a young start up...”\\n-Management only tows the line for Senior Management/Directors, will not be your advocate and will tell you to speak to HR if you have an issue as if HR will do something \\n-Will not give you a raise based on increase work load\\n-The office is freezing year round and dismal. No natural light... Only 2 holidays off in the year. Have to clock out for 10 minute breaks. Only allowed 1 break for 10 hour shift. Feels like a sweat shop. Physically takes a toll on the body. - MANAGEMENT (they always talk about internal promotions but so far I\\'ve only seen external hiring for upper management/higher positions i.e seniors/leads, not very personable at ALL, hypocritical) - nepotism - HIGH TURNOVER - tell people what they can/can not do during their break Management is a bit vague in terms of what is and isn\\'t allowed. Given the casualness of the workplace, it\\'s a bit ambiguous as to what is acceptable. A lot of changes. If you can adjust constantly then this job is for you! This company is the most disorganized organization I have ever worked for. There seems to be a lack of leadership in my area and zero accountability. I sit and listen to my supervisors and managers talk about how they are worked too hard and can\\'t take a vacation. I had high hopes and was excited about my new job position, which has turned out to be nothing like it was described to me during the interview process.... HR doesn’t care \\nMost managers aren’t too friendly\\nPretty clicky Department’s \\npay— starting is $16.50.. you don’t always get a raise and if you do, it’s barely 50 cents every year\\n\\nCan’t really move up unless you’re highly liked by superiors Unorganized back room\\nManagers don\\'t talk to employees with respect \\nA lot of drama \\nFires people with little explanation Long hours\\nStrict demands asked\\nShady managers 10 hour work days, Oversaturation of people doing the same job, Managers have little to no education or knowledge of menswear, management gets paid ~2.5 times what you make, unless you\\'ve been working this 17/hr job for over a year and a half there is no room for upward movement, little to no room for overtime unless you sign up early and are willing to come in on one of your days off...\\n\\nI started working for... Unprofessional sales team overall. Very cliquey and catty. Similar to the environment of junior year in high school. This role is for a inexperienced sales professional who recently graduated from college. It was also shocking how some of the sales development representative would speak poorly about their consignors. I won’t even get into detail about the exchange of conversation in the Google chatrooms. Management is terrible. Has had no experience at being a manager and it is obvious. Doesn’t know how to talk to people at all or have your back at getting paid. Yes I said getting paid. Commissions have been paid when they decide to pay you which is a labor board issue. I was offered job and then job was rescinded based on poor HR practices conducted personally without my permission. Challenging Quotas\\nOut Of The Way Location\\nCold Office Run like a sweatshop. Using hopes and dreams of young creatives to fuel cruel and unrealistic work conditions. Lack of advocacy for employees by management and HR, no room to express how you feel or what can be improved. Disorganized, repetitive, very cliquey, lack of authentic communication across all levels of management, “startup growing pains” masks that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way things are run. The only team who seems connected and has fun, are boisterous and you can feel the creative energy... No such thing as life/work balance, they just want you to work, work, work and work some more. I understand that this is a \"startup\" (it isn\\'t really, it\\'s been around for 7 years now) but people can\\'t be treated like machines. \\n\\nPerformance is very numbers based, and basically any hourly employee gets extremely screwed over here. Salaried employees get treated a little better, though barely. People that are paid... Worked more than full-time; was extensive. The expectations are very high here. Upper management have a lot of pressure to maintain and keep up with quotas, and the production teams are directly effected because of it. It\\'s hard to not feel like a number in the system here, at least in view of management. Its hard to maintain a healthy work-life balance when working here. Overtime is mandatory and can get exhausting. -Environment can get cliquey \\n-Must be okay with change! Opportunity for growth means the company is growing and changing No set corporate ladder. Management does not listen to ideas or constructive criticism Lots of changes, expect the unexpected You have to be okay with change as we are growing so fast! This place is like a dark dungeon with no natural light, poor air circulation, and bathrooms that flood and smell like decomposing bodies. The corporate culture is similar to that of high school but worse. There are very few in upper management positions that have actual experience to make them qualified. Don’t waste your time with this dump! ALL. This company was horrific to work for. Everyday was a new nightmare. They don\\'t care about their employees, customers, or consignors so I\\'m not sure what they really care about. Human Resources is one the biggest jokes I have ever encountered. I worked in NJ location and honestly feared for my life going to work everyday with the type of people who worked there. My car and MANY other car got keyed. Over... -Corporate is misguided\\n-Little job security\\n-Generally unorganized Strict Daily/monthly quotas, workspace air quality isn’t the best, attendance policy is horrible, high employment turnover rate No positive feedback for myself or any of my team members. There was so much negative criticism from management that everyone including myself felt incapable and unwanted, resulting in a lack of motivation. The only support we had was through our equal counterparts. I went home and cried often over feeling worthless. 1. The job description doesn’t tell you exactly what you will be doing, so you thought you would be a photographer, but instead you are just a person who dresses mannequin and clicks button. \\n2. Horrible working environment. The warehouse is dusty and smelly. No windows. Very much like a modern sweatshop. \\n3. The low pay. For the amount of work they are asking, the pay just doesn’t adjust it. They treat you like a... Start-up growing pains, Lots of details to workout, but adds to the enjoyment of the job. Not a real sense of leadership. Scattered goals. Everything else. Manager was awful (sexist, ran hot and cold but mostly aloof), expectations were unrealistic, environment was bleak and uncomfortable and any perks of the job were greatly outweighed by the soullessness of the job itself. - life/work balance could be improved on The struggle is real. You\\'re overworked a lot if you\\'re not in a higher role & the rules change up a lot. Unset schedule \\nLow pay \\nUnder appreciated staff Competitive work, weak feeling of teamwork, chaotic start-up feeling Start-up growing pains but I don\\'t look at it as a con more of an exciting thing of what is to come!! High deductibles for health insurance Changes quickly, online marketplace, office not around bus lines. Low pay and long hours. There is no such thing as a work life balance within this company. Everything else in this company. ESPECIALLY management. If you\\'re in their clique, you\\'re good. If not, prepare to be bombarded with disrespect. Like a lot of startups you will wear many hats which can be good or bad. horrible overtime hours, not enough pay, injuries, the worst HR department, bad communication. Low salaries - The cost of living in the city is ridiculously high, the job isn\\'t easy, and it requires extensive training. It\\'s a job that takes a lot of skill and talent, but the pay does not adequately reward the skill sets required or compensate for the cost of living in the Bay Area.\\n\\nMandatory overtime week - At the end of every month, we all have to work monday-saturday. Having a one day weekend is widely... Are you ready...?\\n\\n+Managers micromanage and try to find more ways of doing so. And it’s so unnecessary.\\n+HR isn’t good for anything. You come to them with an issue and leave with a “good luck” pat on the back. So surprised this company hasn’t had a lawsuit filed against them yet.\\n+Overworked and underpaid. They expect us to photograph hundreds of products a day as if we’re robots.\\n+As a “job well done” gift,... Majority of upper management is unqualified, have been promoted by seniority instead of business acumen. Physical labor carrying upwards of 30lbs of clothing a day, many people in the office complain of back and neck pain. Negative employees, seems no one is happy to be there. Salary is not aligned with workload. A ridiculously low hourly wage\\nNo room for upward movement\\nPoor communication\\nMandatory overtime every month\\nFull day of manual labor\\nPoorly managed new employee training process\\nDirty/Dusty studio that is never professionally cleaned\\nA management team of incompetent and immature people\\nVery high employee turnover\\nTreated like factory worker instead of photographer very much a start-up feel -Absolutely no company culture\\n-High school gossip environment \\n- No organization or structure within company\\n- Low pay\\n- Have to use your own car for work sometimes driving up to 100 miles a day\\n-Depressing work environment Little room for actual advancement. Once your in the role of a specific position it\\'s hard to deviate overworked \\nnot paid enough \\nthey care about quantity over quality \\nwe are all just a number they do not look at us like human beings Salaries can be low for hourly employees, location can be an obsticle have not seen any appreciation to people who work in warehouse The company has consistently struggled with work happiness in the warehouse. I completely understand. It\\'s a very tough job and I always do my best to support those teams however I can. There is no perfect place to work trust me it doesn\\'t exist so yes there are things that the company can work on but that is true for everywhere. I wish we had a better time off program- we get about 3 -4 weeks off a year but you have to wait til you have it to take it and sometimes that\\'s hard for some people to be able to take sick time with pay. I have been here longer so I have been able to carry over my time... The pay is extremely low for the amount of work that is required. The commission is an embarrassment and goals are constantly increased to make it impossible to make the money they say you have the potential of making during the interview process. Management is under qualified and the corporate office is a hot mess, completely unorganized and inefficient.\\n\\nThey deceive clients, telling them certified gemologists... Let me start by stating that please take those negative reviews seriously, and that the positive reviews may have been written by management to balance it\\'s low score. Please make sure to read this thoroughly especially if you\\'re considering going into sales for this company. \\n-PTO that was once offered was retracted and can now only take the time off if you have accrued it. So you cannot take a long vacation until... Not always room for promotions depending on the department. Work was very redundant and boring. No more free lunch as someone pointed out and it can be tedious with a lot expected of you for not enough pay. - This is still a start-up so not lots of processes setup. You create them as you go. \\n- Growing very fast so sometime this creates its own business challenges No more free lunch everyday. Nothing to really complain about. Oh boy where to start. Working at TheRealReal is like having all the life sucked out of you. There is absolutely ZERO work/life balance here as there is REQUIRED overtime, not just once a month as they tell you in the interview, but practically every day. Getting to leave at your scheduled end time is a damn miracle. The pay is abysmal for northern NJ so you feel like you need to work overtime to survive. You only... To be successful here you need to be able to deal with constant change so those who are entry level or don’t have diverse work experience could become overwhelmed while trying to keep up. There is still work to be done when it comes to providing managers with a system to automatically track employee performance. Some roles are only offered at our headquarters in SF, so if your interested in public relations,... Maybe get out the word more, start up an engineering blog? Low salary. \\nLong hours. Poor work/life balance. \\nRelentless pressure to achieve very high monthly goals. \\nBe ready to carry and lift heavy bags. \\nManagement not supportive. \\nHigh school \\'click\\' mentality. The turnover here is insane. Horrible work environment, no room for growth. Managers don\\'t want you to grow and will take all of your credit instead of helping you progress. Only negative attitudes from management and executives and everyone works in fear. Micromanagement when it\\'s not needed and it\\'s not a team environment. Everyone sits quietly and seems so unhappy. It\\'s extremely clicky and if you don\\'t have... This Company takes advantage of its employees. Bottom line, nothing is as important as their profitability and going public with an IPO. They work these poor Luxury Managers to death, and in an abusive manner. A little farther off from Bart, Caltrain The growing pain are felt throughout the organization, but I see management working hard on making necessary improvements. a high school environment in this department \\nManagement needs to get themselves together \\nNo clear directions \\nManagement is very discouraging to employees and very misleading on growth\\nMoreover, they enforce policies and do not follow them then punish you for doing the same as them. \\nwork you like no other even after exceeding expectations You front money for cars, your bonus is a joke, and they track you with your company devices Honestly not even sure why I’m wasting my time writing this review when FAKE CORPORATE REVIEWS WILL BE UPLOADED RIGHT AFTERWARDS to improve their FAKE RATING ON HERE. \\n\\nThis place is a joke. They underappreciate when you exceed your personal goals and look down on people who want to take PTO. Managers are not even competent nor does HR ever respond to your emails in a timely manner. Don’t worry, they’ll respond 5... I agree that they’re unorganized at times but it’s nothing no one can’t handle and like I’ve said they’re a SUCCESSFUL growing company so that will happen but as long as your vocal and open but still respectful you’ll get an answer. There is a lot of work which means there is often times overtime. I wasn\\'t going to waste my time writing this as I vowed on my last day to never give this company another second of my time, but the amount of fake reviews is nothing short of an outrage- not to mention the fact that an internet based company thinks that posting 100 5 star reviews in the course of 2 days isn\\'t a blatantly obvious fallacy. I\\'m embarrassed for them. \\nOn to the real CONS:\\nHigh school environment-... everything. from the interview onwards you will second guess yourself and your work. cattiness reigns supreme. no one doesn’t want to be promoted let’s get that clear but without opportunity what are people supposed to do. PTO is a dirty word No cons at this time Opportunity for growth, great benefits, opportunity to implement process and change, team building, work-life balance, 401 K match It\\'s a start-up even though it\\'s been one for 5+ years and with that comes growing pains. The business moves fast and that comes with mistakes but these are not done intentionally. So if you are a person that needs a button down job with all processes and practices well honed this is not the place for you. Nothing. This place is great! They THINK they know what they are doing with this concept but they actually have no idea. I see a quick success story with a crash and burn like most start ups in the next 2 years. Growing quickly without listening to your people or your customers is a big CON. There is nothing to report yet! Working environment can be a bit suffocating, HR department fails to acknowledge young talent and adamantly adhere to the work-your-way-up process. Management is a huge mess. Only for someone who enjoys a fast-paced work environment. The days can be long You earn what you make of your position! Commission base structure could be stressful but it\\'s achievable! It\\'s a start up still in the sense that you MUST hustle. No one gets a free pass here. Base pay in operations is very low for the bay area. Transparency is lacking, although improving. Goals can be difficult to achieve, but often times they are exceeded. I can\\'t think of one con for this company. You have to come into working here that it is a fast pace environment because we are a start up company, which makes working here so exciting. There is constant change and constant test runs for new things, but being a part of that type of culture, while being successful is very exciting. Definitely a good company if you are looking to stay busy! Days are busy and a new exciting adventure! It\\'s a lot of work (but I love it!) The fast pace and fluidity might not be for everyone, but if you thrive on being challenged, it is the place for you! You need to be flexible and roll up your sleeves. The company is growing fast so being able to adapt to changes quickly is important. If something doesn\\'t feel right speak up. Cannot think of any cons at all. Technology tools for the sales team need updating. Working remotely can be difficult to stay engaged without consistent communication from HQ. Moving so fast, communication among departments and regions is difficult. Work / life balance can be be hard to navigate. I Fell Comfortable Here I Don\\'t Have Any Problems None I can think of The warehouse operations are not an ideal environment for those with Devil Wears Prada aspirations. This is a horrible place to work. They changed out the HR team but they werent the problem. The director and managers run the place and they are the problem. They play favorites all the time and only care about people who dress fashionably. They even go so far to laugh and make fun of us not in their elite group. I talked to the old HR team about the favoritism and how I saw some people treated. I know they tried... The work is tedious which may not be for everyone.\\n\\nNO company culture, generally a negative work environment. People crying in the bathroom/parking lot is a daily occurrence.\\n\\nShuttle service is overcrowded and unreliable.\\n\\nManagers are not trained how to actually do the job required of the depts they manage, so if you have a question about your work TOO BAD your own manager doesn\\'t even know the answer... The lack on communication, the lack of empathy, the lack of proper pay, the pack of time off, the lack of respect, the lack of management competency and most of all the lack of HR and the CEO caring that people are leaving the company at an alarming rate. Waste of time . Lots of favoritism, nothing works , management is a joke ! No cons. Everyone\\'s work matters at TheRealReal so if you are not willing to take pride in your work and give your all every day...this is not the place for you! Working for a start up company means things change quickly and constantly, which I happen to enjoy but it\\'s not for everyone No organization, lack of support from management,\\nHR will tell your manager everything you say IF you even get in touch with them, lazy interview and hiring practices, high turnover rate, work environment can be toxic since bad behavior from favorites goes unchecked, it\\'s not a place to stay with long-term unless you\\'ve been there since the beginning, even people who have been on for years are stagnant with no room... This is the worst place to work! DO NOT APPLY HERE! HR does nothing, if you have a problem with management they will turn it around on you and you\\'ll get in trouble. HR also goes around telling other people your business !!! All the departments in the warehouse sat through construction which was basically illegal for people to working while it was going on! Things from\\nThe ceiling were falling on desks and... We move fast - and sometimes that\\'s overwhelming.\\n\\nWe are still in start-up mode - again, we move fast, and what\\'s more: you\\'ve got to be able to make efficient decisions on your own. Even with all the people we are bringing in, you\\'re still acting as an independent contributor because of the fact that each role is so specific and often crucial in the consumer experience.\\n\\nStructure is still being solidified -... horrible upper management, micromanaging...essentially a company run by twentysomething women who believe they are at a fashion house when in reality we\\'re selling used womenswear. Work/life balance varies greatly between departments. \\nCommunication between teams can be lacking ...Do not apply here it is a cesspool of unqualified so called \\'fashion foward\\' individuals playing dress up. Set your sights for better then this, and look elsewhere this is not the place for you if you really want to get a fashion career started. Even if this just something temporary, don\\'t punish yourself. A day in this place feels like 4 years in high school. \\n\\nI would go further but it seems all the other... Felt like working in a factory\\nDon\\'t encourage speaking up or solving problems that you can fix without management involvement. \\nIf you work as photographer, retoucher or in the warehouse you will be over worked and underappreciated. For somebody who went to school for Fashion or anything in the Arts it really can feel fun and exciting. Unfortunately for a lot of us it turns into a nightmare. The perks get cut, the raises are small or nonexistent, the transportation is unreliable and at times (during snowstorms) nearly deadly. The worst part was witnessing the downright disrespect that managers had towards their employees (in ALL departments).... They offer a lot of overtime If you want to be worked like a slave with no positive encouragement this is the place for you. I have never felt so put down at a job before. People with educated backgrounds who are taleneted suddenly turn into robots month to month. You don\\'t matter at this company. No one cares about you, not even HR. Management is all catty gossip queens. You constantly see new faces because people are to smart to stay at a... There is LOTS of work. This is definitely not your 9-5 job. The company definitely still feels very start-up(ish) and a lot of processes are very manual and labor intensive. It is very much like a high school environment. Lots of gossiping and pettiness. Pretty hostile, if I do say so myself. Anyone can do it. It feels like a factory, and not the fun Willy wonka kind. Although we do get free treats sometimes, so that\\'s cool. Would not recommend to someone looking for something creative and fulfilling. It\\'s a decent job if you just need the money though, and the experience will look...

Long hours six day work weeks It\\'s a startup, and I learned that means a lot of overtime. It also means a lot of changes. Daily. Weekly. Monthly. It can be an extremely rough learning curve, and a very frustrating one at that.

I also don\\'t want to take the energy of 2016 into 2017 (the year of vibrating higher), so that leaves me here and now and still a little petty.

Inconvenient office location and never met the CEO Long hours, some management issues (but what company doesn\\'t have that)? Lack of communication, zero room for growth, preference to hire people from a certain socio-economic background (read: wealthy), absent management. They company sucks. Due to their start-up company they are still growing and learning. So working for a company that doesn\\'t know what they are doing business wise sucks to constantly adjust every time something changes egos/attitudes\\nlack of long-term vision\\nsells items at ridiculous prices\\npoorly trained customer service reps\\nother departments have long response time Improved management communication with field employees. Management is everywhere. Some don\\'t know what they are doing. The reason why TRR is growing rapidly is simultaneously working towards its demise; incredible volume. Directors, VP\\'s, the CEO and managers are blinded by the numbers they aim to procure, yet fail to foster its growth. Watching Trr grow over the past two years is like watching someone blow air into a water balloon- it\\'s just not meant to fill like that, and you\\'re anticipating the pop. \\n\\nEverything they aim to do... It\\'s an expanding business which can lead to growing pains. It would not be a good fit for someone who isn\\'t comfortable working independently. Change can be fast and relentless; those that are unable to embrace the company\\'s system of constant self-evaluation, may find themselves frustrated with the myriad of priorities. Employees are paid a minimal wage. The CEO treats some of her staff like lower-class citizens, often throwing fits and placing blame when monetary goals/deadlines aren\\'t met. There seems to be a large disparity in salaries: the people taking in merchandise, writing product copies, and doing the bulk of the work under pressure just don\\'t make enough money to survive in San Francisco. Meanwhile, web developers and upper management are making 4x your... Horrible company to work for. Was a returns specialist in a warehouse environment with terrible working conditions. Managers are nosey, everyone hates their positions here. Way too much work for $15.00 an hour. DO NOT APPLY HERE!

Terms commonly used by people that work there (and I\\'m trying to be as pc as possible): soul sucking, dysfunctional, disrespectful, unorganized, corrupt, embarassing, sad, depressing, unprofessional, etc. The upper management there gets paid a ton, too much, and the people who do the grunt work don\\'t even get benefits. It is a sad place to work if you aren\\'t constantly sucking up to certain... Absolutely pointless middle management. Useless. 1. The warehouse environment was torturous especially during these hot summer months it felt like a sweat shop! Absolutely horrible they expected us still to hit high goals with it being super hot and showing little care at all. 2. Communication absolutely sucked and management did not know how to speak to people at all. The fact that they feel that they feel they can do whatever they want seriously needs to be... I lost all respect for upper management in my office and the CEO. This company is a good starting point but I wouldn\\'t stay longer then 6 months tops. None to share because this review is based on an experience with a different department. I didn\\'t come here to bash! \\nBut the star ratings below will be rated on my photo editing experience. Everything aside from what was listed above. Especially upper management that is complied of larger children who are incapable of running a team. Everything. This place is honestly the worst company I have ever worked for. Upper management has a very old school approach to everything and whenever a problem arises the classic excuse used over and over is \"we are a start up\" yet nothing operates like a start-up. It is a very traditional corporation environment.\\n\\nColleagues are awful. Everyone has an attitude of arrogance and entitlement and the only time you... No job is perfect\\n\\nYes there are aspects of the company that are not good. Every company has these. Extremely low pay with no chance for advancement. They don\\'t even have an organized promotion track. The general vibe is petulant superiors ( themselves undertrained and scared) ignoring and or berating their staff over ego driven issues. \\'Business critical\\' was earnestly used as a reason to do just about anything. These people don\\'t like numbers (harder to argue with- though not impossible as has been proven!!!) ... A complete mess. No work/life balance. They expect you to give it everything you have and then some. Probably would love it if you just slept under your desk. AVOID this place at all costs! They will promise you up and down future opportunities, but it\\'s completely misleading and it\\'s the company\\'s way of sucking you into a black hole. All they care about it quotas, not developing or learning anything substantial. So. Many. People. are overlooked and undervalued. Managers are petty, gossipy, and borderline useless. If you want to go back to high school and work a dead end job I strongly encourage you... bad working environment and location Raise or promotion? \"You need to perfect where you are now before we would even consider one of those options\" and if you aren\\'t happy where you are, go to another company because they really don\\'t care if you\\'re happy or want to love elsewhere in the company. In reality- you are just a number and there to make numbers for the company. If you are satisfied letting your brain go to mush and sitting in a desk doing a... Management on completely different page from mission statement. You will be bullied and harassed whenever their time permits. HR does not help; completely focused on not admitting they hired terrible management. All depts are a wreck, no one stays with the company longer than one year. Promised opportunity to grow within company but there is never room for you to work anywhere else. Wish there was an online work from home program for those more reliable and independent employees. If you are not hired as a director or senior manager you will probably hate working here. Company is obsessed with improving it\\'s reputation but does no real work to actually improving the culture. \\n\\nSpeaking of the culture... it\\'s terrible. Managers here will take credit for your ideas, freak out over very reasonable PTO requests and are all-around gossipy and catty. \\n\\nCommon theme amongst employees who have... The tasks for a copywriter are extremely repetitive and can get to the point where you feel as if you aren\\'t moving towards anything as far as your career goes. You have to come in for a 6 day work week at the end of the month. None so far. There is a lot of online training that may take awhile to understand but that is to be expected. Bullying managers. Management style is all about intimidation and bullying. Expect to be called names, be yelled at, have your managers gossip about you (and everyone else on your team) and act very aggressively. \\nDishonest work. You will be asked to appraise items without the knowledge to do it, while checking a box that an expert has looked at the piece. If you question this, you will be targeted by your managers... dont care much about promoting guys from the warehouse dept in nj..rather promote from other dept..better pay for warehouse specially the packers! Unrealistic expectations no training, very stressful. Manager never interacts with employees. Could care less about people. Worst place to work. I have not one bad thing to say Low Pay\\nNo work life balance\\nBoring work -Lack of communication between departments/teams\\n-Pay can be improved, especially for employees living in San Francisco/NYC\\n-It is still a start-up and continuing to grow quickly, so patience is definitely needed -No Growth! Management gives run around responses, no actual motivation to grow within the company\\n-Non-negotiable hourly pay\\n-Commute is expensive (The commute benefits HR provides aren\\'t sufficient at all)\\n-Mandatory extra days \\n-Undervalued \\n-Attitude problems from management - This can be good or bad depending on the individual: It\\'s the fashion industry While pay is not incredible, it is comparable to similar positions at other companies, and team bonuses when we exceed our sales targets are generous, which helps a lot. San Francisco is a very expensive city, so commission and bonuses are crucial.\\n\\nOur current location isn\\'t great, though we are soon moving to a location that is more accessible via transit and in a more lively part of town-- currently, TRR offers... -Working in roles we weren\\'t hire to do for extend periods of time, such as processing returns and picking items from the warehouse\\n-No opportunity to provide input like in other start-ups I have worked in Parking in the neighborhood can be challenging Location is terrible. It could be worse, but it\\'s nothing to show off. A free shuttle helps, but you basically either need a car, some strong legs and a bike, a million dollars in Uber credit, or a lot of patience on public transportation to work here. The area is not safe at night. Very few attractive lunch or coffee options in this neighborhood as it is an industrial ghetto. New location is in the works but... Low pay\\nLack of respect from management\\nLack of critical thinking from management\\nCEO is poor decision maker/out of touch with the rest of the company\\nNo time off, common to work 6 days a week, forever\\nZero concern for employee safety, morale or general well being\\nOnly accept a position here if desperate, then immediately start looking for something else. Hyper growth and tremendous month over month growth can sometimes be overwhelming to new employees that want to \"try\" working at a start-up. Growing too quickly to accommodate work flow. People are overworked and expected to shoulder burden. Majority of employees are hourly, not salary. At least half of people who work here cannot afford cost of living in SF. To be fair, in any other city we would doing fine, but still not sufficient. Growing pains of a company that doubles each year, but nothing unexpected. Communication can be challenging especially for remote employees and sometimes lack of communication across departments that directly impact each other can be frustrating. Overworked, absolutely no free time. Company is growing so fast but they are unable to keep up with staffing. Location is kind of secluded in not the best of neighborhoods, working with luxury fashion brought the worst out in some people High quotas, monotonous work. The receiving interface wasn\\'t very well-developed when I was there but it has probably improved a lot since then. -Inexperienced Managers\\n-Boring, monotonous work\\n-Low pay Horrible Work/Life balance, lowballing the industry\\'s standard pay. Company would rather throw more bodies at work instead of compensate employees for all their hard work. Its nice to have more hands to help but those hands also take away work hours. Employees need max work hours because hourly pay is insufficient. Basically the company wouldn\\'t invest in employees and hard workers are not valued.\\n\\nManagers are... SF location is not the safest community. People tend to stay within their department and don\\'t branch out often. To start, many of the manager roles in this company are not deserved, they simply got placed in those positions because they have connections with the executive team upstairs. Within my first couple months of working there I realized that my superior didn\\'t know how to manage our team at all and would make us work extreme hours when it wasn\\'t necessary. Later on down the road, I learned they got their position from... Time management can be difficult The biggest con is low wages and insignificant raises. It is also irritating that NJ employees are paid more for the exact same position in SF, even though cost of living in the Bay is comparable to NY these days and constantly escalating. There is also a lack of communication between management and their employees - in my department the manager rarely speaks directly to the crew and instead has almost completely... As is the case with any start-up, there will be some changes implemented as we grow and need to scale all the existing processes. But everyone is on board in spirit and working towards the same goals. its out of the city, so it can be a long trek getting to work, there are no windows in the building, its really a 6 day a week job Toxic workplace. Ruthless leadership. Tend to require overwork, long hours, and little positive encouragement. Management uses fear to motivate people. Everyone thinks they\\'re going to be fired tomorrow. The most unprofessional, toxic work environment I\\'ve ever had the displeasure to work with. One of the middle managers there was given way too much freedom to reign without being monitored and without adequate work experience to handle her rapidly growing team. She thought she could gossip about other employees within earshot and cross the line personally with some of her subordinates. We often wondered what the... I would say the repetitive tasks that we do daily can definitely get boring. Going to help other departments is sometimes annoying too but it helps improve upon different skills also. This company is constantly patting itself on the back for a job well done, yet how in any sane realm could a company have 100 million in ARR and still be deep deep in the red? The business model isn\\'t scalable. The CEO is extremely nasty unless you work upstairs and partake in the Kool-aid. (Not to mention the fact that ever since TRR took over their Glassdoor account several 5 star reviews with basically identical... The company is growing very rapidly, and that of course can lead to growing pains. Many of the managers work hard to alleviate these growing pains every day, and over time the processes will get better.\\n\\nSenior employees can be spread between many locations and markets, and the company needs to continue to build communication platforms that allow for them to feel as though they are part of the big picture. I really don\\'t have many cons about working for this company other than one main piece.I think that middle management should be looked at more closely and developed so that the bulk of the production workers are being overseen by management that continues to get feedback and knowledge on how to support and inspire their teams.\\n\\nThere are many negative reviews about work life balance but I believe some of those... The environment is very fast paced and unrelenting, which can put pressure on work-life balance. And the company has made more than a few bad hires, who end up causing damage to the business and culture. As the company has grown and become more well-know, this is getting better. There are some managers who are inexperienced and are struggling, which is understandable in a company with so many young people, but... Management acts as if what they say and what they want is the only thing that matters. All they seem to care about is getting more and more orders out of the door and if that means long hours for you, then that\\'s what it is even if there\\'s a blizzard outside! \\n\\nThe company is very gossipy. It\\'s almost as if you\\'re in High School all over again. Sadly, this (mostly) includes management- some of whom are unqualified... The positive reviews of this company were clearly written by management, based on the wording and lack of honesty. The environment is truly toxic and morale extremely low. I often overheard management speaking negatively about the employees and their plans to fire them. Six people were laid off the first two months I worked there and there was very high turnover. The life-work balance was so horrific and you were... This is an internet tech business that is operated as though it were a retail store front. Complete and total lack of understanding of how to implement and support a sales and support organization. Weak commission based compensation with no transparency. \\nTRR exhibits a complete lack of faith in the Director and Management level. This tier of employees is lured in with the promise of being able to be a part of... CEO and senior managers were often hostile and dismissive to other employees in an open environment. A lot of the rules and policies seemed arbitrary and changed regularly. CEO was open about not wanting anyone to take vacation days. Long commute\\nStart-up / e-commerce hours can be taxing - Startup culture meaning hard work. Must be willing to go above and beyond.\\n- Not your traditional 9 to 5. Have to be willing to put in long hours and get things done. If you enjoy giving up your entire life (and I am not exaggerating here) to working at a place where everyone takes themselves too seriously and can\\'t seem to get any team organized, then this is the place for you. Employees are warned during their orientation on the first day that it is pretty much impossible to get days off during the last half of the month due to an overwhelming amount of shipments and sales... Questionable hiring and promotion practices: this is a workplace where employees have been verbally offered promotions only to find that the position had been filled by an outside candidate days later, promotions have been offered to employees with very limited relevant experience who have personal ties to Executives, employees have relocated cross-country to fill open positions that were not in fact available at... Very political. Very demanding. Exploitative. - Hard work - This is not for everyone. If you want a 9-5 job, there are companies that do that. If you want to contribute and make an impact in a company, this is for you. You will not be promoted in 90 days, so some people that want instant gratification for doing their job and coming to work on time, are often dissatisfied.\\n\\n- Work on weekends and on some holidays. Often this does not sit well with everyone,... Working for this company is an absolute joke. Upper and middle management appear to have no idea what they are doing. They do not know how to properly guide their employees. They are very gossipy and if you\\'re not careful you can get caught up in the high-school like drama. I was surprised to see the men even act this way. The CEO doesn\\'t care about anything but making more money and of course her precious Birkins.... There is slightly poor communication between management and their subordinates. Occasionally, directly contradictory information will be relayed. People waste time, and organization is a joke. Also, the old cliche of 10% of the people doing 90% of the work is completely true, at least in my dept. Furthermore, interactions between coworkers often bear a striking resemblance to those between rivals in High School,... Lack of an effective inventory system means there are hundreds of items that are missing and have to be paid for by the company.\\n\\nWorking literally around the clock- having to report to managers 7 days per week and never actually having a day off.\\n\\nIf you bring clear, justified grievances to HR and executives. You will be quietly dismissed from the company. Letting a bad manager continue working and become a... Re-located to the bay on my own dime for what I thought would be a higher paying with commission position with room for growth and wound up being put in the warehouse to assist the individuals with the job I initially applied for, for very low pay. Apparently the company favors individuals who love and possess high-priced designer items over those with education, industry-specific experience and high work ethic... There is little room for rest or mis steps. As a start up, things are evolving at a high rate, and you have to be on the top of your game to keep up, let alone help drive. At points, I get too much pressure from the business side to accomplish tasks that require time and thought to complete intelligently. When I first joined the company a year ago, the development pace was frenetic as we were just launching a full rewrite of the site. Unfortunately, the first wave of mostly contracted developers were lacking in the skills needed to make a well organized, well functioning site. ... Location is terrible - you\\'ll need to have some form of transportation or be okay with 45 min of bussing around to get to the place. Consequently, food choices at lunch are limited, though there are a few healthy and tasty options around.\\n\\nFiring isn\\'t always done the most diplomatic way. We\\'ve had to cut slack, but I\\'m not sure the way we did the cutting was the best.\\n\\nWe hire Indian sub contractors to do some... Requires lots of hours. Must be willing to be a self-starter. Work can be long hours. Anyone investing in this company should really look at the business fundamentals, and ask why it is that the more traffic the site gets, the more money The RealReal loses. Additionally, it should be mentioned that within a year, the company burned through 2 CTOs and 3 VPEs. The current CTO is non-technical, and relies heavily on outsourced labor or employees who speak very little English. No focus on the people who make the company run. The push is to make the company grow no matter the cost\\n\\nFor a two year old company, highly dis-organized, unstructured with little to no process or policies in place. Almost no documentation about anything. \\n\\nLack of an effective inventory system means there are hundreds of items that are missing and have to be paid for by the company. There aren\\'t even apparel... Expected to give up your life to work there for little to no pay. They hire you as an expert but the CEO and other management don\\'t trust your decisions. Need for investment in systems to support operations. Very demanding 24 hours a day As an engineer, I was expected to work nights and weekends. I wasn\\'t given much credit for the work I did. In fact, on a couple of occasions, higher-ups took credit for work I did. The various people who have come in and out of the engineering leadership roles have made some seriously bad decisions -- and this is happening to this day. - The CEO and senior executives routinely badmouth employees within earshot\\n- The CEO routinely berates employees in front of the entire company (open seating on mezzanine)\\n- Communication is poor\\n- Environment is political\\n- The ability to be creative is minimal at this stage of the company Poor pay, poor management, poor HR department, poor corporate culture. The majority of my time spent working there was extremely negative. No incentives for those who were performing well. There was some conflict with the Lead Engineer and the Project Manager, but not much.'"

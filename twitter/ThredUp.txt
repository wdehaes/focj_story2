On the other hand, the Gianni Bini bag I ordered from @thredUP came today. The chocolate brown color I needed, beautiful, in perfect condition, and under $18 with their coupon. #happiernow
@thredUP_support thanks for responding to my issue, really shows me that you're interested in customer service.
@Kris10Callihan I've tried to go the sustainable route and have bought most of my clothes through ThredUp
@thredUP_support @giligy @thredUP Ya, that doesn't sound right at all.
@giligy @thredUP That's horrible! Get it back.
@Rebecca__Reeder @thredUP Hi Rebecca, thanks for reaching out! We're happy to review this matter. We will be sending a reply to your DM shortly!
Hi @thredUP_support ‚Äî you charged me $200+ for a goody box that I returned a week ago because none of the items fit. Can‚Äôt seem to get ahold of you. What is going on?
@thredUP_support @theskimm I returned 2 items and tracked the package and it was received by Thred Up on the 16th.  When will I see a credit on my Thred Up account?
@thredUP_support I have a question about the payout on a bag I sent in. The ‚Äúconfirmed payout‚Äù amount I see ($7.10) is less than the total payout of all the sold items ($36.90 currently)? Can I get some clarification on how that works?
I like to buy 2nd hand clothes from Thredup. I get great deals.
So my husband says, "Is there something like Thredup for men?"
I told him, "No. Because men wear their clothes until they can't be worn any longer"
Austin pipes up, "But you know what there is for men? Ross" üòÇüòÇ
How can the directive for changing the shipping address of an order I JUST MADE be to contact customer service immediately... and they are ‚Äúcurrently outside business hours‚Äù @thredup What now?!
@thredUP I have watched and watched so many rescue box unboxings!!!!  I tried for the very first time: Rescue Fun Box.  I thought I would share this video in this group.

@giligy @thredUP Hi Grace! At thredUP, we aim to be the most convenient way to pass along your unwanted clothing responsibly. If you'd like to talk about your earnings further, please send us a DM here at Support!
Anyway I ordered a bunch of Thredup bags just now because I‚Äôm planning to donate a bunch of clothes so...stay tuned?
So, that trip to the post office was from hell, but on the bright side I saw people bringing all these white and green polka dot bags for drop off and learned that they were Thredup bags?

@thredUP_support this is the second time I've tried to place an order and my order was declined. Plenty of money on my card. Could have bought that bag 10x over. Never again thred up.
@Sharon_Boller @Nordstrom @TrunkClub Check out @thredUP. They have boxes too and all clothes are used (very green). I've gotten really high quality stuff from there (cashmere sweaters, nice blazers) for cheap and everything looks new.
@thredUP_support @theskimm Hey! I've emailed, tweeted, contacted customer support but I get no response. I'm trying to find an order that I placed last Saturday for $105. My card was charged, but I've gotten no confirmation at all. The order doesn't even show up in my order history. Please help.

My first ever #thredup review!
@thredUP_support I ordered a goody box 12 days ago and it hasn't shipped yet. Sent an email and was told it would take 7-10 days to get a response and to use the chat feature. Just tried the chat feature and was told it would take an hour to get a response. Not impressed.
I can say definitively my wardrobe is 50% #secondhandfirst. Linen, cashmere, silk, oh my! @thredup

Madewell teams with ThredUp to sell secondhand jeans
Het stigma van #tweedehands kleding en schoenen behoort binnenkort tot het verleden. Volgens een rapport van doorverkoop platform ThredUp dat onlangs verscheen, is deze markt in de afgelopen drie jaar 21 keer zo hard gegroeid als de reguliere moderetail.
Now were talking! #reselling @madewell
@thredUP_support Hi. I returned an item for credit but it's now listed for sale on my account. I did include the return sheet. The Customer Service rep who replied to me just did a cut and paste of FAQs. Not very helpful. How can I get some help? Been waiting well almost 2 weeks.
So good I had to share! Check out all the items I'm loving on @Poshmarkapp #poshmark #fashion #style #shopmycloset #thredup #crocs #oldnavy:
For a program called "Madewell Archive," Madewell and apparel resale e-retailer ThredUp have teamed up to offer secondhand jeans in select stores, for $50 per pair     via @RetailDive  @daphnehowland

@JulieSu90368841 Okay Julie, I have not heard of the "Thredup cashout card", however if it was a Discover card, and is a Cashback but not credit card, then I would think it is most likely our Cashback checking (Debit) card. Does that sound right? *Jason
@thredUP_support I would love to gift Goodie Boxes to family members for the holidays. Is there a way to make this happen? E-gift cards, maybe? Then they can set up their accounts and style profiles?

Here's the thing about poshmark (and similar apps like thredup). You can still get loads of name brand clothes, but you're avoiding giving any money to the companies that aren't using fair labor practices. It's a way of staying fashionable without directly supporting abuse.

This is why I hate thredUP-- inaccurate product descriptions and this dress is brand new, never worn (now discounted after months and probably won't sell because fall). Is there a better alternative?

@ennuyeux12 @thredUP_support @thredUP Exactly!
@LindsayEHoppe @thredUP I think they are ‚Äúrejecting‚Äù items and then selling them later for 100% of the profits. I just tried to cash out my earnings and found out they keep a percentage of that now. I‚Äôm sure they will tell me it‚Äôs covering some ‚Äúfees‚Äù or something.
@ChelseaRhane @thredUP Yes, but now they take a portion of your earnings if you try to cash out instead of using it to purchase on their site.
@wowthanksguys @thredUP Truth!  The payout averages around 12% which is lower than any resale shop or site. On top of that they now only give you a portion of your earnings if you try to cash out instead of use it to shop on their site. Really underhanded.
@thredUP_support  Why are my legitimate sales, which you have already profited from,  only worth 88% when I try to cash out?  That is really not appropriate. I already only make average 12% of the sale price and now you are going to take more of it? Please tell me I am wrong!
Hi @thredUP ! I never know the answer - is the waist measurement listed the diameter or circumference?

@thredUP I cashed out by requesting a prepaid Discover card 2 weeks, still have not received. When will I get it? Cashed out $600 which I would really like to have.
Just putting this here... üéÅüòáüëâ
Want to clean out your closet and sell clothes? I recommend ThredUP. A great company that sells used clothes. I have only had good experiences with them. Save the planet - recycle your clothes!
I want to only buy natural fiber clothes from now on like this dress.

@Victoria__rhae @mariah_grace1 AGREED. i &lt;3 ThredUp!!!!
I‚Äôm sick of having a cluttered closet so I‚Äôm selling my clothes on @thredUP ü§©
@ChelseaMDO1 My saving grace is shopping at ThredUP for second-hand work clothes. Thrifting takes time though. And I‚Äôm still tired of hearing ‚Äúno way! You‚Äôre too young to be a professor!‚Äù when I‚Äôm a 34yo PhD.
@Traveljerzgirl Sadly, not anytime soon! It is a possible future consideration but not within our scope at the moment. The only option is a Men's Rescue box. Check it out HERE:
@momarazzirochmn Please DM us and I can help!
@mariah_grace1 I‚Äôve found a ton &amp; also ordered a ton on ThredUp!!!! It‚Äôs AMAZING
Smartphone resale apps like ThredUp are changing the way we buy and sell online
@caeulio Thank you! I got it from Thredup, but it's an R&amp;K cowl neck dress. Poshmark seems to have some similar ones

Super-nice #shirtdress! Thanks for checking it out.
Okay, whose brilliant idea was THIS
Lol @thredup this is a tube top, not a skirt.

After the customer return window passes on your sales, ThredUp releases your profit to you and you can spend it on the site or send it off to your PayPal account.
In August, they changed their sales model to 100% consignment and the sellers have some control over the prices. It's pretty cool. In 3 weeks, I have sold 30+ items and ThredUp listed 158 more for me. Listing that kind of inventory would take me WEEKS on another platform.
I print my own labels and you can specify if they get to donate what ThredUp doesn't want to list, or you can get stuff in your box back if you agree to pay $10.99 out of your profits.  They also give you a chance to reclaim what you have for sale after a short waiting period.
@thredUP_support  I emailed about a week ago at this about being charged incorrectly.  I got an automated response that someone would reply within 5 business days.  Please look into this.

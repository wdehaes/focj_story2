At first, the future of fashion will look retro, but eventually, because clothes degrade, that won’t be enough. “Fast fashion as we know it will no longer exist and we will have more localized micro-communities making clothes." #retail  #prediction
I hope all those signs are made of biodegradable materials &amp; non toxic paints and all those protesters are wearing secondhand clothes and have second hand mobiles/cameras etc if not their all...HYPOCRITES.

4. No cell phones or video games.
5. No debt/credit cards. Save and pay cash.

@CarolynLake @MadeleineSeys @katharineleila I think it's different to wear clothes that also serve a function for the working class (jeans used to do that, i've seen you wearing jeans) vs spending money on clothes that are LESS FUNCTIONAL in order to mimic a look that the poor wear because of money (torn/secondhand/worn)

I hate seeing all the tat they fill these places with nowadays. I want plants in a garden centre, ffs. Maybe a bag of soil. Some bird food. That's it. Also: when antiques shops start selling secondhand clothes and even cards, as I saw the other day, you know they're in trouble...

@ColdWarScience @divafancypants My love of clothes and dearth of finances is exactly what led me to write a history of secondhand styles and economies! I did just spent $160 on booties yesterday because after back surgery this summer, I need high-support shoes. I believe in spending in quality when I can!

@SeyiJayeola @AfricaFactsZone Probably is as Rwanda is quite forested. National pride is swollen here. They didn't care about the threats from the US about sanctions if they stopped importing secondhand clothes. Putting your people first.

from the ages of 13-19 I dressed almost exclusively to get people to pay as little attention to me as possible, and it's only now that I'm starting to try and break that, but I still want to get clothes from secondhand stores because I can spend 50 bucks on 10 shirts instead of 2

@Unrealized_Tomb It was open 24 hours because there was a pachinko parlor onside somewhere. You could buy secondhand clothes and books, too, but I stuck to the toys and games.

There are so many people who come into my shop with clothes inside out or flies undone and I never tell them because I don't want to feel that fleeting secondhand embarrassment 
Does that make me a bad person?
